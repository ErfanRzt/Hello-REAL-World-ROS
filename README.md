# Hello (REAL) World with ROS
<div align="justify">

The Robot Operating System (ROS) enables you to quickly build robotic applications through access to a large set of open-source software and tools. Over the years, ROS has become the essential tool for roboticists. A large community surrounds ROS and there has been extensive input from industrial users in the development of these tools.

TU Delft offers the MOOC [**Hello (Real) World with ROS**](https://www.edx.org/learn/robotics/delft-university-of-technology-hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-system) which is available on the edX online learning platform. The course is self-paced, free, and will remain open until October 13, 2024. 

Subsequently, this repository represents my work through this course. It is tried to present worthwhile summaries along with profound practices and additional resources. However, there might be some limitations on providing full answers to the quizes and computer assignments according to the edX Honor Code.

- Installation of Ubuntu-Linux, course simulation setup and supporting software.

**Week 1: ROS Essentials** 
- Introduction to ROS Topics, Services, Actions, and Nodes.
- Simple interaction with the course simulation environment.

**Week 2: Build your own robot environment** 
- Software representation of a Robot using Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)
- ROS parameter server and adding real-world object representations to the simulation environment.

**Week 3: Autonomous Navigation**

### edX Honor Code

Put simply, the edX Honor Code states that, by enrolling in an edX course or program, you agree that you will:
- Complete all tests and assignments on your own, unless collaboration on an assignment is explicitly permitted.
- Maintain only one user account, unless edX has approved the use of a separate user account in connection with an employer-sponsored or university-sponsored program.
- Not let anyone else use your username and/or password.
- Not engage in any activity that would dishonestly improve your results, or improve or hurt the results of others.
- Not post answers to problems that are being used to assess learner performance.

Youâ€™ll find the entire edX honor code [here](https://www.edx.org/learn/robotics/delft-university-of-technology-hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-system).
